Title: Choosing a cone to move
        Start:  Sanbo and Fyll are playing a round of "Mensch ärgere Dich nicht".
                Sanbo plays for the red team, and Fyll plays for the blue team.
                Sanbo has 3 cones standing on base and one cone on game field, on position 3 
                counting from the red start (position "red A").
                Fyll has 1 cone standing on base and 3 cones on game field, one on the starting position, signed with 0
                (position "blue A"), and other ones on positions 5 and 10 counting from the blue start.
                It's Fylls turn to throw the dice.

        Action: Fyll throws the dice and gets a 5.

        Result: With the dice outcome being 5, not all of Fyll's placed cones can be moved freely.
                Cone on the starting position shouild be moved first, but it cannot reach the position 5, because
                there's already another cone standing there. The cone on position 5 cannot be moved as well,
                besause there's a cone on position 10, which blocks the movement.
                The only movable cone for Fyll will be the one on position 10. 
                The other cones stay immovable for this turn.

                counting from the red start (position "red A").
                It's Sanbo's turn. She had already thrown the dice and got a 1.
                She can now decide which cone to move.
        
        Action: Sanbo decides to move the cone on the position 22 one step further.
        
        Result: The moved cone lands on the Fyll's cone and kicks is back to the base.

        Action: Fyll throws the dice and gets a 2.
        
        Result: With the dice outcome being 2, not all of Fyll's placed cones can be moved freely.
                Cone on position 44 had already reached the final postion on the game field and cannot be moved further.
                Cone on position 39 cannot be moved, because there's a cone on the final position 40, 
                and the cones on final positions cannot be jumped over.
